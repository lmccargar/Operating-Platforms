**Summary**
Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) a theoretical technology software design company has hired me as a junor software developer. CTS has recently taken on a new client, The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room is interested in developing a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only. 
**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
Apparently I did well on the evaluation part of the design docmuent. In particular in the server side and development tools on the software design template.
**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
I would say laying out the different server, client, and development tools section of the evaluation part of the document. It was helpful to see the different platforms and the advanges and disadvanges of each platform. 
**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would probably revise the UML diagram. I did not have much experience with UML and could see the benefits of this part of the design. Imporving my knowledge with the UML diagramming would have certainly improved it. 
**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
Using the software design template was a guide in the interpretation of the customers' needs. Knowing where they started from an Android only application and expanding to multi platform design, helped in taking the customers' needs and expanding upon it. I think what's important is to fully understand what the user's needs and compare their needs to the technology. In some case the technology is there easily implemented and other times it might take thinking out-of-the-box design work for a seamless experience. This makes for a better user experience of any applications.
**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
I tried to approach this design with an opened mind and a willingness to learn. The evaluation part of the design template is benfical in future development projects. We are able to see what is would help minimize issues, as well as, aiding in the thought process during the design.
